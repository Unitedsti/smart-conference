    <h3>If You Do not Receive the Instructions</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;">If you do not receive our email with instruction on how to create an account, please read the following information.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Our mail server normally sends all mail within a few seconds. The following is an incomplete list of possible reasons for the problem.</p>
    <dl style="margin-left: 40px;"><dt><i>Incorrectly typed email address</i></dt>
        <dd>This is still the most likely cause of delays.</dd>
        <dt><i>Slow mail processing</i></dt>
        <dd>Some mail servers process mail for a long time. For example, you mail server may spend a lot of time checking incoming mail for spam.</dd>
        <dt><i>"Reply-me" mail protection.</i></dt>
        <dd>Some mailers, when receiving an email from an unknown sender, ask the sender to send a mail with specific content to ensure that it has been sent by a human. Account-related emails in EasyChair are sent by a computer program, so if your email address uses such a protection, you will never receive our mail. If you have such a protection and it is configurable, configure it to accept email from the domain easychair.org.</dd>
        <dt><i>Mailbox problems and quotas</i></dt>
        <dd>Some emails sent by EasyChair bounce back because the recipient mailbox is over quota.</dd>
        <dt><i>Anti-spam filters</i></dt>
        <dd>It is possible that your spam filters will classify our email as spam. Please check your spam mail boxes.</dd>
        <dt><i>General connection problems</i></dt><dd>There might be general connection problems, for example your mail server may be unreachable for a long time.</dd></dl>

        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">Unfortunately, we have no resources to cope with all possible kinds of mail server (mis)behavior. If you believe you have a problem related to your mail server and want to solve it   quickly, either contact your system administrators or try to get and use an email address from one of major mail hosts, such as a Google Mail, Yahoo Mail, or Hotmail. You will be
        able to change your email adress in EasyChair or have multiple email addresses associated with your account later.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 60px;">You can repeat your application at any time. Another email will be sent to you.</p>
